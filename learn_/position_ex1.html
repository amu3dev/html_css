    <h1>Relative and Absolute for Card Layouts</h1>
    <p>
      Imagine you want to create a profile card with a photo in the top-right
      corner of the card. Here’s how you’d do it:
    </p>

    <div
      style="
        position: relative;
        width: 250px;
        padding: 20px;
        background: hsl(64, 36%, 84%);
        border-radius: 8px;
      ">
      <div style="position: absolute; top: 10px; right: 10px">
        <img
          src="images/1.png"
          alt="Profile Picture"
          style="width: 50px; height: 50px; border-radius: 50%" />
      </div>
      <h3>John Doe</h3>
      <p>Web Developer</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Explnation</h2>
    <p>
      The outer div has a relative position, which means that the inner div with
      the profile picture will be positioned relative to the outer div. The
      inner div has an absolute position, which means that it will be positioned
      relative to the outer div. The top and right properties are used to
      position the profile picture in the top-right corner of the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outer div (the card) is positioned relative, so the inner div with the
      profile picture (positioned absolute) will be 10px from the top-right
      corner of this card, not the whole page.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
